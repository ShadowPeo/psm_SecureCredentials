In Addition to the licence conditions spelled out in the attached licence, the Victorian Department of Education is prohibited from utilising this resource until they treat their technicians like people and not slaves and are prohibited from using it in any way to support SCL or SID initiatives, permanently for the former, and until there is full public disclosure including the PIA to all staff with no reservations or NDA's on the later, this is not to say that individual schools cannot use the resource, they are most welcome to, DET themselves, however, cannot.
